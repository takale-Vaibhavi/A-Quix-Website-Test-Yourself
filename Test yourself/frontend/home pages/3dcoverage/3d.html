        Our 3D Coverage approach means that we don't just test surface-level understanding. 
      We go deep into each topic by covering:
      </p>
      <ul class="coverage-list">
        <li><strong>1. Core Concepts:</strong> Basic theory and definitions.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Applications:</strong> Real-world use and practical problems.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Challenges:</strong> Advanced-level thinking and competitive-level questions.</li>
